# Time to practice

## Loading dataframe

```{r}
#| label: load-libraries
#| output: false  
library(tidyverse) # load the tidyverse libraries, including readr
```

Let's first load the dataframe we created in todays class (03/09).

```{r}
#| label: read-google-sheets-data

FactVegComp_link<-"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zccYYcYs67R42hjMpQn6uO1TqQfVfuluZ5LIb6MBuas/pub?gid=1168998728&single=true&output=csv"
FactVegComp<-read_csv(FactVegComp_link)
```

Lets now produce some nice graphs.

Bar Plot of Average Cover Percentage by Species:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(FactVegComp, aes(x = Species_ID, y = CoverPerc)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean", fill = "steelblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Average Cover Percentage by Species",
       x = "Species ID",
       y = "Average Cover Percentage")
```

Grouped Bar Plot: Cover Percentage by Species for Each Transect Point:

```{r}
ggplot(FactVegComp, aes(x = TransectPoint_ID, y = CoverPerc, fill = Species_ID)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean", position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Cover Percentage by Species for Each Transect Point",
       x = "Transect Point ID",
       y = "Average Cover Percentage")
```

Stacked Bar Plot: Cover Percentage by Transect Point and Species:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Assuming your abbreviated species IDs are like "SP1", "SP2", etc.
# and you want to replace them with full names like "Species One", "Species Two", etc.

ggplot(FactVegComp, aes(x = factor(TransectPoint_ID), y = CoverPerc, fill = Species_ID)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "sum") +
  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c("fes rub" = "Festuca rubra", "pla mar" = "Plantago maritima", "puc mar" = "Puccinellia maritima")) +  # Full names
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Cover Percentage by Transect Point and Species",
       x = "Transect Point ID",
       y = "Cover Percentage",
       fill = "Species")  # Legend title
```

# Beautifullll :)
